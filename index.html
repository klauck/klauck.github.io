                <h1>Hi 👋</h1>
                <p>I am a data management researcher and software engineer from Berlin.</p>
                <p> I was a research assistant in the Enterprise Platform and Integration Concepts Group of Prof. Plattner at the Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam.
                    In May 2023, I handed in my dissertation titled “Integer Linear Programming‐Based Heuristics for Partially Replicated Database Clusters and Selecting Indexes”.</p>
                <p>
                    I loved my time as a PhD student, particularly (i) conducting research, (ii) working with other researchers and students, (iii) teaching, and (iv) coding:
                    (i) The reason for my passion for research can be summarized by the following quote of Peter Bailis’ blog post “I loved graduate school”: » [...] by the time you’re done with your dissertation, you’ll have answered questions no one ever answered (or possibly asked) before.«
                    (ii) During my time at university, conferences, and Schloss Dagstuhl, I have met many other enthusiastic and inspiring people (I still admire Andy Pavlo for his love to databases.).
                    (iii) For me, teaching is a great chance to educate and inspire other people.
                    (iv) Naturally, I also love building software, including contributions to our open‐source platform for evaluating index selection algorithms, supporting the development of the Hyrise database system, and implementing demonstrations of research systems.
