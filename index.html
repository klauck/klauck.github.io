                <h1>Hi 👋</h1>
                <p>I am a data management researcher and software engineer from Berlin.</p>

                <p>Recently, I joined Prof. Markl's <a href="https://www.tu.berlin/en/dima">Database Systems and Information Management group</a> at TU Berlin.</p>

                <p>Before, I was a research assistant in the <a href="https://hpi.de/plattner/home.html">Enterprise Platform and Integration Concepts group</a> of Prof. Plattner at the <a href="https://hpi.de/">Hasso Plattner Institute</a> in Potsdam.
                    My dissertation is titled “Integer Linear Programming‐Based Heuristics for Partially Replicated Database Clusters and Selecting Indexes”.</p>
                <p>
                    I loved my time as a PhD student, particularly (i) conducting research, (ii) working with other researchers and students, (iii) teaching, and (iv) coding:
                    (i) The reason for my passion for research can be summarized by the following quote of Peter Bailis’ blog post “<a href="http://www.bailis.org/blog/i-loved-graduate-school/">I loved graduate school</a>”: » [...] by the time you’re done with your dissertation, you’ll have answered questions no one ever answered (or possibly asked) before.«
                    (ii) During my time at university, conferences, and <a href="https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/">Schloss Dagstuhl</a>, I have met many other enthusiastic and inspiring people (I still admire <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/">Andy Pavlo</a> for his love to databases.).
                    (iii) For me, teaching is a great chance to educate and inspire other people.
                    (iv) Naturally, I also love building software, including contributions to our open‐source <a href="https://github.com/hyrise/index_selection_evaluation">platform for evaluating index selection algorithms</a>, supporting the development of the <a href="https://github.com/hyrise/hyrise">Hyrise</a> database system, and implementing demonstrations of research systems.
